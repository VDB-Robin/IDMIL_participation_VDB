# Bloc M5

This folder contains the files of the block intended to maintain the M5 module in the Probatio. This block is in two parts and uses the common base of size 1X1.

The two STL files (part 1 and 2) are ready to use and can be inserted directly into 3D printing software.

To prepare this block correctly several steps are necessary:
1. Print parts 1 and 2.
2. Prepare the base with the pogos.
3. Place and glue a connector (see picture) on part 1.
4. Weld the wires to the connector (inner side).
5. Glue part 1 and 2 together.

For more details the wires must be soldered with this assignment:
1. GND
2. VCC
3. SDA / G0
4. SCL / G26

For additional information, photos of the final result and of the welding phase are also available in this repertory.
