# IDMIL_participation_VDB
Repertory consigning all the participations of Robin Vandebrouck on the Probatio project within the framework of his end of studies work.

The main purpose of this participation is related to the creation of an intelligent musical generator that can be used with the Probatio project, another IDMIL project.
The Probatio is a toolkit for the creation of new digital musical instruments. Its two objectives are on the one hand to offer new possibilities for creation, and on the other hand to decrease the cost in time and effort for prototyping. This contribution (and especially the generator) has been designed to enhance these two key objectives.


This GitHub contains several elements, most of which are related to the intelligent music generator. Indeed, only the Bloc_M5 folder is not related to the generator, and contains as its name indicates, the files related to the Probatio block designed to host an M5 module.
