REQUIEREMENT

To work properly the generator needs a number of libraries in addition to a python installation (Conda/Anaconda recommended).
Also, be careful with the versions selected during installation, as you should not work with the latest versions of all libraries.

python == 3.7
numpy == 1.19 (Attention, necessary to downgrade to this version!)
tensorflow == 1.15
magenta == 2.1


Caution with the installation of Magenta :
pip install magenta
sudo apt-get install build-essential libasound2-dev libjack-dev portaudio19-dev
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta.git
pip install -e .
pip install . (if problem)

For more details see the link below (github of Magenta) :

Small other libraries such as mido or pygame are also necessary for the code to work properly. 
Nevertheless, unlike the three others, there is no particular problem of installation for these other dependencies. 
The easiest way is to run the code and install the libraries requested by the error messages.



NOTES

During imports, it is very probable that you will get an error message mentioning a problem with "llvmlite".
To fix this problem: Run "pip install llvmlite --ignore-installed". 
Then retype the "pip install ... (the library you are trying to import)".
