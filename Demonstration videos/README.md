(You will find in the folder to which this link leads three versions of the demonstration video: the long, medium and short version).

This demonstration is based on the use of the generator coupled with the Probatio. The idea of this demonstration is to place the output of the generator as the MIDI input of a music synthesis software. The software selected here is Ableton.
The Probatio blocks are then used to modify the parameters of the musical synthesis in a direct way. 
Moreover, to allow the interaction between Ableton and Probatio another IDMIL project is used: Mapper4Live.
